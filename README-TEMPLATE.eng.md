## Compiled PDF

The document is written in [Typst](https://typst.app/) _(which is better than LaTeX)_.

- A compiled PDF is automatically generated on every push to `main` and available in the [releases](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/releases).
- Alternatively, it is possible to compile locally with the command: `typst compile main.typ`

## Workflow

Pushing to `main` (and thus PDF generation) is protected:

- it is necessary to create a pull request to propose changes
- a review by a collaborator is required for the merge
- a temporary PDF is automatically generated for each pull request
